<p style="color:yellow;font-size:275%;">THE INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p> lets discuss the importance of language of expressions for a while.....
<br>We all require a medium to share our thoughts and ideas; sometimes we use our expression to exhibit our emotions . expressions are one major way of manifesting the feelings. 
<br>In this sense we can certainly state that expression is a kind of language, and we all use it along with the spoken language as well.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-size:300%;"> "The limit of my language is the limit of my world"</p>
<p align="right"> - Ludwig Wittgenstein 
<p> Explanation : The ability to name things, and understand each other when doing so, is one of the key things that sets us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom.The word limit does not stand for the extremity,rather it means the achievements of human to learn something which does not come within the reach of other animals.
<p style="color:green;font-size:300%;"> "A man will be imprisoned in a room with a door that's unlocked and opens inwards; as long as it does not occur to him to pull rather than push."
<p align="right"> - Ludwig Wittgenstein
<p> Explanation : Well, this is very well related to our lives. We all find ourselves inside the locked rooms ,within the four walls, and wish to escape out. we don't have a gumption to try out new things ,forgetting what has already happened.Even a pinch of sadfulness in nature of a person can make him slothful in taking the ways which might take him to his achievements. Bumming around inside four walls wishing for someone to rescue will make us weak. You need to be conscious and try the world. know more and more about the unknown things , explore until you know the maximum a person can learn. You'd never know which of the code will let you out of the room. Look for the keys of brains.
<p style="color:green;font-size:300%;"> "The human body is the best picture of the human soul."
<p align="right"> - Ludwig Wittgenstein
<p> Explanation : This is very true . we find the soul, talk a hundred words about spirituality and souls.Some make assumption that a soul(which is something mysterious and can not be expressed in words)lies within the body od a living being, some states that soul is an imaginary entity which controls the human body, its functioning, and human behaviour. The external human or the the body is the best way to observe the soul. Something which can be only thought of is best to be represented in the simplest possible way.Human behaviour and actions clearly manifests the soul of a person.
